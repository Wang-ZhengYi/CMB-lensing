# lens_img

## This is a flat-sky CMB lensing demo for teaching.

### created by Bin HU and Zhengyi Wang @ BNU

1. run [lens_img2.py](lens_img2.py), which produces an unlensed primary CMB map according to the input spectrum.

2. run [lens_template.py](lens_template.py), which produces a inverse square(or cubic) lensing potential map.

3. run [dif_matrix.py](dif_matrix.py) , which produce a matrix of computing 2d gradient. 

3. run [mixing.py]mixing.py, which produces the lensed CMB map.
